# High Level Design

## Architecture

This application would have a monolithic architecture.

Reasons for this decision:

- This is the initial design for this project.
- Being a home server, monolith is preferable as there would not be too high traffic to have an optimized microservice architecture.
- Microservice based architecture was much of an overkill here
